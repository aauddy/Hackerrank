Solution:

select h.hacker_id, name , count(challenge_id) as challenge_counts
from hackers h inner join challenges c
on h.hacker_id = c.hacker_id
group by h.hacker_id, name 
having challenge_counts = (select max(xchallenge) from (select count(challenge_id) as xchallenge from challenges group by hacker_id)maxchallenge)
or 
challenge_counts in (select xchallenge from (select count(challenge_id) as xchallenge from challenges group by hacker_id) as xchallenge group by xchallenge having count(xchallenge)=1)
order by count(challenge_id) desc, h.hacker_id
